# java tasks

# note: the following included tasks might configure and enable stuff in common_packages
# requires 
#   Debian_{tasks,services}.yml
#   RedHat_{tasks,services}.yml

# must use include because doesn't like dynamic content and won't look right path
# this is ugly because import_task doesn't look in the right place until 2.7
